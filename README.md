# Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts Website

# About
Arts and crafts website were I have to set up the files on my computer and build the website with only design specs provided by Codecademy. I am utilizing HTML and CSS to create
this project with little to no guidance from Codecademy. 

# Debugging Journey
Having worked with HTML and CSS in the past, I thought this project was going to be a piece of cake. I was working a little fast and confident that I would get it on the first go. As I was working on the HTML, I was able to get the page running without much problem. Once I got the CSS, I had to stop and double check a few sections. 

When I had to post the background picture in the header h1 section, I was struggling to position it <em>behind</em> the h1. I had done it before on past projects but could not remember the exact code. I kept making the same mistake and only posting "background-image: url("pattern.jpg"). I was certain that this was solution and had looked it up on MDN, W3 and other websites. It matched the code I found online and was checking for mispelled words, missing letters or quotes, parenthesis etc. I decided to comment out the code and started my research again. I eventually remembered that sometimes you have to add "../img/" when your have the images in another folder. I had done this in past projects but my memory was just not working with me in that moment. Once I added that, it worked and the rest of the project went smoothly. 

# Checking my code with the solution
Once I finished the project, Codecademy offered a solution. I checked it against mine and for the most part the CSS was just about the same and the HTML had a few differences. I decided to add "section id" to the body while Codecademy added "div class". I was surprised by this but also happy to know that you can achieve the same result using different code. This is why I LOVE code!

# Thoughts
Even though this is a fairly beginner project, I was met with some minor bugs. I was able to practice writing HTML and CSS from memory which was a great way to practice what I already know. Highly recommend you try it!

It was a good refresher on building basic websites and I'm glad I tried a new project!
